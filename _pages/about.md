I'm a doctoral candidate in [Organizational Science](https://orgscience.charlotte.edu) at UNC Charlotte. 

My guiding research objective is to understand the organizational communication that enables the development of safe and responsible technologies. I also collaborate on research at the intersection of technology and organizational identity, membership, and team processes. I use mixed methods approaches to develop and answer research questions.
