To understand contractors’ communicative construction of their organizational membership, we analyzed contract workers’ descriptions of membership negotiation in Big Tech using crowdsourced company reviews (n = 500). Contract workers noted their positions enhanced their career development but also described being constrained in negotiating full inclusion within organizations, influencing work processes, and changing their membership status. We discuss the findings’ implications for understanding and practicing membership negotiation in nonstandard work arrangements."},{"name":"Electronic Communication","publisher":"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Psychology","releaseDate":"18-10-2023","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.283","summary":"Electronic communication, encompassing email, social media, and artificial intelligence, profoundly impacts individuals, their relationships, personal identity, group affiliation, and community functioning.

This chapter examines the unique risk-related dynamics of the gig economy, proposes a new theoretical framework, and suggests directions for future research on occupational safety and virtual communities in this context."}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Quantum Mechanics","Quantum Computing","Quantum Information","Quantum Cryptography","Quantum Communication","Quantum Teleportation"]}],"references":[{"name":"Professor John Doe","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
