This chapter examines the unique risk-related dynamics of the gig economy, proposes a new theoretical framework, and suggests directions for future research on occupational safety and virtual communities in this context."}],"interests":[{"name":"Organizational Communication","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Sensemaking","Membership & Identity","Ethics"]},{"name":"Technology","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Ethics of Artificial Intelligence","Virtuality","Digital Platforms"]},{"name":"Research","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Qualitative Methods","Text Mining & NLP","Social Media"]}]}
